This appendix is used as a reference to all the code that was used to generate tables, matrices and results including analysis. Code was written in R and would require edits depending on the name and location of files used.

Reference to the below-mentioned links are included as these contain the files that were used for analysis and derived either through manual curation or R code.

This link is to the Google Drive containing all the excel spreadsheets used to contain the data/information used in the comparison and analysis:

The file “Compiled_done_2.xlsx” contains the matrix of compiled, deduplicated and standardised names that were used for comparison. The data in the file is arranged according to the database of origin. Within each sheet, column headers are in Row 1. Of note, Each column contains a different number of elements.

The file “Combined_data.xlsx” contains 5 presence-absence matrices in 5 sheets respectively. Each sheet contains data elements and values with regards to the sheet title. Data from this sheet was compiled and reorganised from “Compiled_done_2.xlsx”. The left-hand side rows contain the elements/values according to the sheet title. The first row contains the column headers of the respective databases compared using the presence-absence matrix. 1 indicates the presence of the value/element in the respective database and 0 indicates otherwise.

The file “Total.xlsx” is the combination of all 5 sheets into 1 large sheet to compare all aspects for analysis. Data layout and formatting is the same as “Combined data.xlsx”.

The file “Source_Comparison.xlsx” is a list of all the known sources that could be manually obtained through data mining of the databases themselves as well as their respective journal articles according to their respective databases.

The file “Reference.xlsx” is a summary of all the data present in the respective databases after manually extracting the information out of each NME in each database. The data are arranged according to the respective NMEs.

The file “Headers.xlsx” was used for the creation of Figure 10. It was created after manually extracting information out of each NME in each database. Due to the differences in naming of NMEs across databases, the NMEs for some databases were renamed and standardised with that of other databases as can be seen from the legend below. Hence, when referring to the original database NME names, it may differ. This was to allow for the comparison to be conducted on the various databases.
